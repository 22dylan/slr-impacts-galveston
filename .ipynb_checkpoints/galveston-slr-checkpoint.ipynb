    "The first step of the framework is to identify future water levels relative to a vertical reference datum. Total water levels at the shoreline can be defined as the sum of mean sea level, deterministic or astronomical tide, non-tidal residuals, and wave runup (Ruggiero et al., 2001). Depending on the community being considered appropriate aspects of total water level should be identified. For example, if a community is protected by a vertical sea wall, then considering wave runup may not be appropriate. When identifying the future water levels, the timeframe of analysis is also identified, e.g., 2025 to 2100. Multiple SLR scenarios should be identified in step 1 to account for uncertainty in future climate conditions. Local projections of SLR should be considered, as these can differ from global and regional projections due to factors such as vertical land motion (Sweet et al., 2022). "

    "\n",
    "The second step of the framework is to determine the impacts of SLR on infrastructure. This step considers the spatial extent of flooding resulting from increases in water level, but does not consider when this flooding will occur. Modeling the extent of flooding can range from static approximations to more complicated physics-based models. The former consists of bathtub models in which high water levels are overlaid on a digital elevation model to get water depths and inundation extents (e.g., NOAA, 2017). The latter consists of full physics-based models that capture hydrodynamic processes (e.g., Luettich et al., 1992). In between these two are reduced-physics models that solve simplified equations compared to their full physics-based counterparts (e.g., Leijnse et al., 2021). The framework shown in Fig. 1 can accommodate any of these approaches. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"figures/fig1-step2.png\" width=\"60%\"/></center>\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Step 2 of the framework begins with considering an inundation footprint at 0 m. above the same vertical datum identified in Step 1. With this inundation footprint, the impacts to buildings, electric power, and transportation network are computed. Impacts to the building inventory are first determined by overlaying the inundation footprint on the building inventory. Every building in the building inventory is identified as being exposed to water or not. Exposure can be defined as either: (1) whether the water level exceeds the first-floor elevation, or (2) whether there is any standing water at the buildingâ€™s location. These results are saved in a SLR impact database that will be used as a lookup table in Step 3. Impacts on the electric power system are then computed by overlaying the inundation footprint on the electric power system. Every building in the building inventory is assigned to a substation and it is assumed that if a substation is exposed, it cannot provide electricity to the buildings it services. These results are stored in the SLR impact database. Next, impacts to the transportation network are determined. The inundation footprint is first overlaid on the road and bridge transportation network to determine whether each road/bridge segment is exposed. The depth of inundation at each road segment is determined and results in either an increase in travel time along that segment, or the road segment becomes unpassable. Depth-disruption curves can be used to determine the maximum safe speed along each road segment (Pregnolato et al., 2017). Destinations in the road network are then identified and can be any point of interest in a community, such as grocery stores, libraries, schools, or medical facilities. The shortest path from every building to each destination are computed using the resulting travel times along each road segment. The travel times from each building are stored in the SLR impact database <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This process is then repeated until each inundation footprint is considered. For example, the next inundation footprint could be defined as 1ft. (0.3048 m.) above the vertical reference datum. Considering all inundation footprints results in a populated database that stores the impacts of increasing water levels on each building in the community. The database considers impacts for multiple infrastructure systems, e.g., for electric power the results are whether each building has electricity, whereas for transportation, the results are travel times from each building to a specific destination. The database can then be quickly queried, rather than having to run an inundation model and determine the impacts to infrastructure. \r\n"

This step begins by considering the first future water level scenario that was identified in Step 1. The start year is initialized and daily high-water levels for the entire year are determined. For each daily high-water level, the impacts to infrastructure from the SLR impact database are queried. This is done by matching the daily high-water level to the nearest inundation footprint that was used in Step 2. The importance of using the same vertical reference datum is emphasized. This process repeats for each year of the future water level record, and then repeats again for each future water level scenario. Step 3 results in community-wide impacts of SLR on multiple infrastructure systems at the building level.
